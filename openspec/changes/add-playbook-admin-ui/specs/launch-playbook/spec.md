## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Gate sequence orders the launch

A launch playbook SHALL define its ordering as a sequence of commitment gates, each representing a point at which money, stock, or public exposure becomes irreversible. The sequence SHALL be exactly the following eight gates in this order:

1. `commit` — the product is worth developing
2. `order` — the purchase order may be placed
3. `listable` — everything buildable without stock or a live listing is ready
4. `stock-ready` — sufficient fulfillable units are available
5. `live` — the listing may be switched on
6. `ignition` — the marketing launch may fire
7. `phase-one-complete` — the ranking push has done its work
8. `graduated` — the launch is over

Gates SHALL remain the only *commitment* ordering primitive in the playbook. Step definitions attached to the same gate SHALL additionally carry an authored order relative to one another — a total order within the gate, exposed by the served step set and followed by every consumer that lists a gate's steps. This within-gate order SHALL carry no commitment semantics: it SHALL never affect when a gate opens, which steps block it, or how step completion is evaluated — reordering a gate's steps changes how they are listed, and nothing else.

#### Scenario: Gates expose a stable order

- **WHEN** the playbook's gates are read
- **THEN** they are returned in the defined order, each carrying its position in the sequence
- **AND** two gates never share a position

#### Scenario: Steps at a gate are served in their authored order

- **WHEN** a gate's steps are read from the served playbook
- **THEN** they arrive in the gate's authored order
- **AND** two reads with no intervening write arrive in the same order

#### Scenario: Steps at the same gate are unordered

*(Retained name: "unordered" now means unordered to the commitment machinery — the authored order exists, and this scenario pins down that it never reaches an evaluation.)*

- **WHEN** a gate's steps are reordered and the gate's advancement, blocking evaluation, and step completion are then evaluated
- **THEN** the commitment machinery treats the gate's steps as an unordered set: each evaluation comes out exactly as it did before the reorder
