## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The step form carries every authorable field

The step form SHALL offer every field the authoring capability accepts: the name, the description, the assignees, the kind, whether the result needs confirmation, the status, the hazard, and — for an `automated` step — the automation brief and the handler, alongside the gate, scope, timing anchor and blocking flag it already carries.

The name and the description SHALL be distinct inputs, and the description's input SHALL accept more than one line: a single-line box for a field whose whole purpose is to be longer than the name would teach the author the opposite of what the two fields are for.

Assignees SHALL be chosen from the roster's active people rather than typed, so an author cannot name a person who does not exist and cannot mistype an identifier. The people offered SHALL be identified by their display names, since an author knows colleagues by name and not by generated identifier.

Fields that carry no meaning for the step's current kind — an automation brief on a `human` step — SHALL either be hidden or render disabled, so the form does not invite a value the write would refuse.

#### Scenario: The form offers name and description separately

- **WHEN** a step's form is opened
- **THEN** the name and the description are separate inputs, and the description accepts line breaks

#### Scenario: Assignees are chosen from the roster

- **WHEN** the assignee control is opened
- **THEN** it offers the roster's active people by display name, and does not accept a free-typed identifier

#### Scenario: A form rejected by validation shows every fault with the typed values

- **WHEN** a submitted step violates two of the new field rules at once
- **THEN** the re-rendered form reports both faults and still holds what was typed, and the step set is unchanged

### Requirement: Steps that are not active are visible to authors and set apart

The page's default view SHALL show every `draft`, `in-development` and `active` step the authored set holds, and SHALL make each step's status legible. `retired` steps SHALL stay behind the explicit control that already reveals them, as they do today — the page reads the authored set by the same path that control already uses, which now answers with every status rather than adding a second read — retirement is the end of a step's life and does not belong in the working view, while a draft is work in progress and does.

Steps that are not `active` SHALL be visibly set apart from the served set rather than interleaved with it, so an author can tell at a glance which steps a launch is actually being held to. They hold no slot in their gate's order (`playbook-authoring`), so they SHALL render no position among the gate's active steps rather than a misleading one, and the reorder controls SHALL remain unavailable while they are shown, exactly as they already are while retired steps are shown.

A step's assignees SHALL be shown on the table alongside it. A `human` step that is `active` and shows no assignee is a state the write rules forbid, so showing assignees is what makes that rule's effect visible rather than merely enforced.

#### Scenario: Draft and in-development steps are shown and marked

- **WHEN** the page is opened against a set holding a draft and an active step in the same gate
- **THEN** both are shown, each carrying its status, and the draft is set apart from the served set
- **AND** the draft renders no position among the gate's active steps

#### Scenario: Retired steps stay behind their control

- **WHEN** the page is opened with no control engaged
- **THEN** retired steps are not shown, and draft and in-development steps are

#### Scenario: Assignees are visible on the table

- **WHEN** a step naming two assignees is rendered
- **THEN** both are shown by display name alongside the step

### Requirement: A step's status can be changed from the page

The page SHALL offer changing a step's status, including activating it. A refused change — an activation whose step lacks what its kind requires, or a de-activation that would leave a gate unheld — SHALL be surfaced on the page carrying the refusal's own explanation, and SHALL leave the set unchanged.

#### Scenario: An activation lands and the step joins the served set

- **WHEN** an author activates a step carrying everything its kind requires
- **THEN** the step is shown as active and among the served set

#### Scenario: A refused activation explains itself

- **WHEN** an author activates a `human` step naming no active assignee
- **THEN** the page shows the refusal's explanation and the step's status is unchanged

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The step table shows the live set whole

The admin page SHALL render every live step of the served playbook in one
table, grouped by gate in the gate sequence's order, with each gate's
steps in their authored order. The table SHALL be filterable by gate and
by discipline, and searchable by the text of a step's name **and** its
description; an active filter or search narrows what is shown without
changing the underlying set. Retired
steps SHALL NOT appear in the default view, but SHALL be reachable
through an explicit control that shows them marked as retired, so that
un-retiring is possible from the page.

Searching both fields is what keeps search useful once the two are
separate: an author who remembers a phrase does not remember which of the
two fields they wrote it in.

Each live step SHALL render its own position among its gate's live steps,
together with how many live steps that gate holds. The position SHALL
reflect the whole gate, not the narrowed view, so that an admin working
under a filter can see where a step sits in the order that is actually
persisted.

#### Scenario: The whole live set is one page

- **WHEN** the admin page is opened with no filter active
- **THEN** every live step is rendered, grouped by gate in gate order, each gate's steps in authored order

#### Scenario: Filters narrow without altering

- **WHEN** a gate or discipline filter is applied
- **THEN** only the matching steps are shown, and the underlying step set is unchanged

#### Scenario: Search matches description text

- **WHEN** a search term is entered that appears in one step's name and in another step's description
- **THEN** both steps are shown

#### Scenario: Retired steps are reachable but set apart

- **WHEN** the control that shows retired steps is used
- **THEN** retired steps are shown marked as retired, and are not interleaved with the live set

#### Scenario: A position is read against the whole gate

- **WHEN** a filter narrows a gate to a subset of its live steps
- **THEN** each visible live step renders its position among that gate's live steps and the gate's live count
- **AND** those positions are unchanged by the filter
